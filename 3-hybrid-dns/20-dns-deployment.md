# DNS Deployment


Run the CloudFormation template 3.tgw-dns.yaml to deploy the Bind server in the DataCenter VPC as well as the remaining AWS Route53 components

</br>

<b>HOW TO Deploy the Bind Server</b></br>


1. Click on the CloudFormation Launch link below that corresponds to the AWS Region in which you deployed the first stack:

	[![US East (N. Virginia)](https://samdengler.github.io/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/images/us-east-1.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=tgw-dns&templateURL=https://aws-iberia-networking-workshop-virginia.s3.amazonaws.com/3.tgw-dns.yaml&param_AvailabilityZoneA=us-east-1a&param_AvailabilityZoneB=us-east-1b&param_ParentStack=tgw)
	
	[![EU West (Ireland)](https://samdengler.github.io/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/images/eu-west-1.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=tgw-dns&templateURL=https://aws-iberia-networking-workshop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3.tgw-dns.yaml&param_AvailabilityZoneA=eu-west-1a&param_AvailabilityZoneB=eu-west-1b&param_ParentStack=tgw)

1. Give the stack a name, enter the name of your first stack (must be entered accurately) and select a DNS compliant domain name, such as **example.com**. Click **Next**.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Review name_of_your_stack** and check the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.** Click the **Create** button in the lower right.
